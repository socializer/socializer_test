# Application-wide view helper methods.
#
# Methods defined in this module are mixed into view contexts so they are
# available across templates and partials. Keep helpers focused on presentation
# logic; move complex business logic into models, decorators, or view components.
#
# @example
#   # formats a date for display in views
#   def formatted_date(date)
#     date.strftime("%b %d, %Y")
#   end
#
# @see ActionView::Base
module ApplicationHelper
