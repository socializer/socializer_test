# The ApplicationHelper module is a place to define helper methods that can be used across your application.
# Helper methods defined here are automatically included in Rails views.
# Currently, this module is empty, but you can add methods as needed.
#
# Example:
# def format_date(date)
#   date.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
# end
#
# This would make the `format_date` method available in all views, which could be used like this:
# <%= format_date(@user.created_at) %>
#
module ApplicationHelper
end
