# The ApplicationRecord class is an abstract base class that
# other models in the application inherit from.
# It is a direct subclass of ActiveRecord::Base.
#
# This class is primarily used for defining methods and behaviors
# that are shared across all models in the application.
#
# The `primary_abstract_class` method call indicates that this class
# is abstract, and therefore, instances of ApplicationRecord should not be
# created. This method is provided by ActiveRecord.
